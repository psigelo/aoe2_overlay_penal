Download the executable from [this link](https://github.com/psigelo/aoe2_overlay_penal/releases/tag/tkinter).

Create a file named `profile.txt` in the same folder as the executable (or a text file named `profile`) and enter your account's serial number by following these steps:

1. Go to [https://aoe2-overlay.neyl.dev/](https://aoe2-overlay.neyl.dev/).
2. Search for your username.
3. Copy your profile ID and paste it into the `profile.txt` file.

You can find your profile ID in the navigation bar (itâ€™s a number, without any text).
